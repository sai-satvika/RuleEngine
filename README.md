Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
Objective
This project implements a 3-tier rule engine application that determines user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, and spending. The system uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent and dynamically manage conditional rules, allowing for the creation, modification, and combination of rules.
